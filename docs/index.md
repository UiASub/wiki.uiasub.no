## Edit the wiki (MkDocs quick-start)

These steps follow the official MkDocs getting started guide: <https://www.mkdocs.org/getting-started/>

1. Install MkDocs (Python required):

   `pip install mkdocs`

2. Serve the site locally from this repo:

   `mkdocs serve`

3. Open the local preview:

   `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`

4. Edit Markdown files in `docs/` (including this file at `docs/index.md`).
   MkDocs reloads the site when you save.

5. When you're ready to publish, build the static site:

   `mkdocs build`
