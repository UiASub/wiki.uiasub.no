# Quick start

## Install dependencies to run

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to use git

To create a new branch

```bash
git checkout -b <branch_name>
```

Work on the Branch

- Make changes to the code as needed.
- Stage the changes you want to commit

```bash
git add <file_name>
```

- Alternatively, stage all changes:

```bash
git add .
```

Commit Your Changes

- To commit the staged changes

```bash
git commit -m "Your descriptive commit message"
```

- Make sure the commit message is clear and explains what the changes do.

Push the Branch to the Remote Repository

```bash
git push
```

Sync Your Branch with the Main Branch (Rebase)

- Before merging your branch, make sure to update your branch with the latest changes from the main branch:

1. Switch to the main branch:
2. Pull the latest changes:
3. Switch back to your branch:
4. Rebase your branch onto the latest main branch:

```bash
git rebase main
```

- Resolve any merge conflicts that arise during the rebase

Merge Your Branch to the Main Branch

1. After a successful rebase, switch to the main branch:
2. Merge your branch into the main branch:

```bash
git merge <branch_name>
```

After a succsefull merge push the changes

```bash
git push
```

If you want to checkout another branch whith uncommited changes

```bash
git stash
```

NB: This will discard your local changes
